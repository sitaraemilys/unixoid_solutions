mkdir temp
cd temp
gem install unixoid-challenge

1. Using one command, create a directory structure "my/private/files"
mkdir -p my/private/files

2. Using one command, create a directory structure "my/public/files"
mkdir -p my/public/files

3. Create an empty file 't-vars.env' in my/private/files
touch my/private/files/t-vars.env

4. Using command-line only add the line "List of env vars that begin with T" to the file, make sure it ends with a newline
echo “List of env vars that begin with T” >> my/private/files/t-vars.env
vi my/private/files/t-vars.env
insert line

5. List all env variables that begin with "T" (hint: you'll need a regex that includes the marker of the start of the line) and append them to the end of the file
env | grep ^T >> my/private/files/t-vars.env

6. Export a new variable TESTING_MAKERS=working in such a way that it is still available when you open a new shell
export TESTING_MAKERS=working
echo "export TEXTING_MAKERS=working" >> ~/.bash_profile

7. Open a new terminal window, check that a new variable is available
echo $TESTING_MAKERS

8. Output the count of the variables that begin with T to a new file my/public/files/t-vars.count, e.g. "Overall count: 5" (hint: you'll need to use 'command substitution' in bash)
env | grep ^T | echo "Overall count: $(wc -l)" > my/public/files/t-vars.count

9. Change the permissions of the my/private/files/t-vars.env to make sure that only the owner can read and write the file
cd my/private/files
chmod go-r my/private/files/t-vars.env

10. Change the permissions of the my/private/files directory to make sure that only the owner can change into it
chmod 700 Desktop/temp/my/private/files

11. Give read and write permissions to all users on my/public/files/t-vars.count
chmod 666 my/public/files/t-vars.count

12. Create another file my/public/files/text-files-count.txt and output the number of text files in your home directory (recursively) into that file
find ~ -name "*.txt" -print | wc -w > Desktop/temp/my/public/files/text-files-count.txt

13. Create another file my/private/files/first-three-env.txt and output the first three env variables from a list of all of them sorted alphabetically
touch my/private/files/first-three-env.txt
env | sort | head -3 > my/private/files/first-three-env.txt

14. Create another file my/private/files/commands.txt and output the contents of the history command to that file
history > my/private/files/commands.txt
